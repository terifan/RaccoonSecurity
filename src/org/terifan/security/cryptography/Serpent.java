/**
 * Serpent is a 128-bit 32-round block cipher with variable key lengths, including 128-, 192- and 256-bit keys conjectured to be at least as
 * secure as three-key triple-DES.<p>
 *
 * Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen as a candidate algorithm for the NIST AES Quest.<p>
